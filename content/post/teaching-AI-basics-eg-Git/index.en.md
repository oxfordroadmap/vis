Based on my teaching and curriculum-developing experiences in China that features the modern web development using [GitHub](https://github.com/education) and producing/reviewing students' portfolios of PRDs, prototypes, and intelligent apps, I have carefully designed a full foundational course of "Web Development for LLM-Powered Apps" that features building intelligent Apps using LLM.  It aims to replace or complement CS 101 courses for all disciplines, including management and humanities background.

## Course Info and Features

Aimed at entry-level undergraduate students from a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds, the course series **🤖📲** _**Web Development for LLM-Powered Apps**_ (hereafter _This series_) provides a comprehensive foundation in both the conceptual and practical aspects of modern web development in the context of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

### Course Series Structure
Spanning **two semesters** (12–18 weeks each, depending on institutional scheduling), the course is structured as follows:

* Web Development — 
  * Foundations and CI/CD using Github
  * Foundations for LLM-Powered Apps

This course emphasizes applied practice, technical fluency, and ethical awareness through the integration of LLMs into accessible, user-centric web platforms.

### ✨ Course Features 

_This course series_ emphasizes the following **action-oriented** learning outcomes, each grounded in Blooms' Taxonomy’s higher-order verbs and mapped to real-world development practices:

- 🏗️ **Construct** a capstone **project** 🎓 — integrating AI capabilities, multilingual interfaces, LLM APIs, and interactive data visualizations.
    
- 🌍 **Design** inclusive, multilingual **experiences** 💱 — incorporating WCAG accessibility, sustainable design principles, and internationalization/localization (i18n/L10n).
    
- 📢 **Communicate** technical **decisions** 🗄 — through structured documentation (MRDs, PRDs), interactive prototypes, deployed apps, and rubric-based peer evaluations.
    
- ⛏ **Clarify** foundational **concepts** 🧠 — including HTTP protocols, web standards, responsive layouts, Hugo modularity, Tailwind workflows, and prompt design for LLMs.
    
- 🧩 **Compose** responsive **user interfaces** 🗗 and interactive **visualizations** 📊 — using Hugo page bundles, TailwindCSS, and Apache ECharts to build tables, network graphs, geographical maps, and more.
    
- 📎 **Manage** multimodal and structured **assets** 🗂️ — such as images (vector vs. raster), video content, structured datasets (.json, .yaml, .csv, .xml), and production-ready HTML/CSS/JS.
    
- ⏿ **Orchestrate** reproducible **deployments** 🛫 — through Git-based version control, automated bundling, CI/CD workflows, and open-source configuration strategies.
    
- 🔌 **Integrate** LLM-powered **APIs** 📲 — to generate adaptive content, support real-time interactions, and implement prompt-to-page web flows.
    
- 🧭 **Evaluate** ethical and human-centered **implications** 🕵 — addressing algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, and Responsible AI principles

Together, these features illustrate how students, through a **project-based learning journey**, can continuously expand, revise, and reflect on, their growth. 

Culminating in a capstone **project** 🎓, each learner’s contributions, peer-review, peer-learning and feedback cycles are tracked and recorded on GitHub to foster transparency and real-world readiness.

##### In short
**Intelligent** Web Development requires continuous learning skillsets that leverage modern platforms such as Github for professional project-based traceable professional practices. 
{{% /callout %}}

Two course syllabus are provided as follows:
* First, learners build a modern responsive website using Github, learning the fundamental components, Web knowledge, design practices, and basic deployment operations.
* Second, learners build several LLM-powered Apps (and other projects) that feature intelligent value-adds to their well-curated portfolio of documents, projects, interactive data dashboards, etc.

After finishing the _this course series_, each learner will align their interests and practices, growing with the world-leading projects and contributors on platforms such as Github and Huggingface. 

### 💪1️⃣ Foundations and CI/CD using Github

_The first course_, called ***"Web Development—  Foundations and CI/CD using Github*** integrates essential `Web Design`, `Web Development`, and relevant `software & AI engineering` knowledge, with strong focus on practical applications using modern coding and deployment platforms such as Github.  

Learners are also expected to **observe, learn, and practice** critical software engineering skills in **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment** (CI/CD),  aiming at automating and streamlining software/Web development lifecycles.
