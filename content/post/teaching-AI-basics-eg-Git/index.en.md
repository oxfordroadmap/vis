Based on my teaching and curriculum-developing experiences in China that features the modern web development using [GitHub](https://github.com/education) and producing/reviewing students' portfolios of PRDs, prototypes, and intelligent apps, I have carefully designed a full foundational course of "Web Development for LLM-Powered Apps" that features building intelligent Apps using LLM.  It aims to replace or complement CS 101 courses for all disciplines, including management and humanities background.

## Course Info and Features

Aimed at entry-level undergraduate students from a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds, the course series **🤖📲** _**Web Development for LLM-Powered Apps**_ (hereafter _This series_) provides a comprehensive foundation in both the conceptual and practical aspects of modern web development in the context of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

### Course Series Structure
Spanning **two semesters** (12–18 weeks each, depending on institutional scheduling), the course is structured as follows:

* Web Development — Foundations and CI/CD using Github
* Web Development — Foundations for LLM-Powered Apps

This course emphasizes applied practice, technical fluency, and ethical awareness through the integration of LLMs into accessible, user-centric web platforms.

### ✨ Course Features 

_This series_ features the following **action-oriented** course features (with verb–noun pairs and icons, using **Bloom’s action verbs**):
- 🏗️ **Construct** a capstone **project** 🎓 — integrating AI capabilities, multilingual interfaces, LLM APIs, and data visualization pipelines
- 🌍 **Design** inclusive, multilingual **experiences** 💱 — incorporating WCAG compliance,  accessible/sustainable design, and language localization (i18n/L10n)
 - 📢 **Communicate** technical **decisions** 🗄 — through structured documentation (MRDs, PRDs), interactive demos, Apps, and rubric-based peer reviews
 - ⛏ **Clarify** foundational **concepts** 🧠 — covering http protocols, web standards, responsive design, modular design, Hugo workflows, Tailwind layouts, and LLM prompt mechanics
- 🧩 **Compose** responsive **user interfaces** 🗗 and interactive **visualizations** 📊  — using Hugo page bundles, TailwindCSS, Apache ECharts, and reusable component strategies to create tables, network graphs, maps,  etc.
* 📎 **Manage** multi-modal and structured **assets** 🗂️ — including images (vectors vs. rasters), videos, structured data (.json, .yaml, .csv, .xml), and build-optimized web content (.html, .js, .css)
- ⏿ **Orchestrate** reproducible **deployments** 🛫 — with Git-based version-controlled workflows, automated content bundling, CI/CD pipelines, and open source resources
- 🔌 **Integrate** LLM-powered **APIs** 📲 — for dynamic data-driven content, generative API, generative content, and prompt-to-page workflows   
- 🧭 **Evaluate** ethical and human-centered **implications** 🕵 — addressing transparency, user data handling, algorithmic bias, and responsible AI practices

Altogether, the course features a project-based learning journey with a capstone **project** 🎓 that document the growth of individual learners with tracked records on Github platform.

### An Education Technical Note
Using and extending [Syllabus Components by Harvard](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/syllabus-design), this post focuses on the following in the university learning context:
- 🎯 **Course Goals / Learning Objectives**
- 📅 **Weekly Breakdown / Course Schedule**
- 🧩 **Final Project / Capstone (if applicable)**
- 🧮 **Grading Criteria / Assessment**
- 🌐 **Technology & Online Tools**

The following details are beyond the scope of this post:
- 📚 **Course Materials / Texts**
- 🧠 **Course Requirements / Assignments**
- 📌 **Course Policies**

This character network graph is based on [the dataset](https://github.com/XianWoo/SNA_Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber/blob/main/relationship.csv). Only **the top 25** nodes by weighted degree are included, and only links value equal or larger than 25 are kept.  

### Graph

Note that the node size is scaled proportionally.

 Clusters are constructed according to their family or role (e.g., Jia family main branch, Jia family Ning branch, Xue family, maids/servants, and others). Each cluster is assigned a unique color/category. This approach is intuitive for this novel’s characters and visually meaningful, without running a full community-detection algorithm.

### Cluster assignments and colors

- Red: Jia family main branch 
  - 宝玉, 贾母, 王夫人, 贾琏, 贾政, 贾探春, 贾惜春, 贾迎春, 李纨, 邢夫人, 贾蓉, 贾珍, 贾环 
- Blue: Xue family 
  - 宝钗, 薛姨妈, 金钏
- Green: Maids/servants 
  - 紫鹃, 妙玉, 秋纹, 平儿
- Orange: Other close kin/friends 
  - 凤姐, 史湘云, 秦可卿, 尤氏 
- Purple: Main protagonist 
  - 黛玉
