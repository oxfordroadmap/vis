 abstract = {Integrated technology management in building smart ports or intelligent ports is a crucial concern for global sustainable development, especially when human societies are facing increasing risks from climate change, sea-levels rising, and supply chain disruptions. By mapping the knowledge base of 103 papers on intelligent ports, retrieved in late December 2022 from the Web of Science, this study conducted a roadmapping exercise using knowledge mapping findings, assisted by Bibliometrix, VoSviewer, and customized Python scripts. The three structural (intellectual, social, and conceptual) aspects of knowledge structure reveal the significance of the internet of things (IoT), the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), digitalization and supply chains, and the need for digital transformation alignment across various stakeholders with Industry 4.0 practices. Furthermore, an even geographical distribution and institutional representation was observed across major continents. The results of the analysis of the conceptual structure demonstrated the existence of several established and emerging clusters of research, namely (1) industry data, IoT, and ICT, (2) industry 4.0, (3) smart airports, (4) automation; and (5) protocol and security. The overall empirical findings revealed the underlying technology and innovation management issues of digital transformation alignment across stakeholders in IoT, Industry 4.0, 5G, Big Data, and AI integrated solutions. In relation to roadmapping, this study proposed a socio-technical transition framework for prototyping ecosystem innovations surrounding smart sustainable ports, focusing on contributing to valuable carbon or greenhouse gas emission data governance, management, and services in global value chains.},
