💓 Motivate students to learn by doing their own portfolios of PRDs📋, prototypes, and AI agents 🤖! 

Based on my teaching and curriculum-developing experiences in China that features modern web development using <i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [🤗Hugging Face Hub ](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index), I have carefully designed a full foundational course of "Web Development for LLM-Powered Apps" that features building intelligent Apps using LLM, and producing AI agents within 24 weeks.

It aims to replace or complement CS 101 courses for all disciplines, including management and humanities background.

## Course Info and Features

Aimed at entry-level undergraduate students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, the course series 🤖📲 *Web Development for LLM-Powered Apps* (hereafter  _this series_) provides a comprehensive foundation in both conceptual and practical aspects of modern web development in the context of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

> See how  _this series_ covers diverse disciplinary backgrounds including `engineering`, `management`, `marketing`, `psychology`, `design` and `new media` based on emerging job markets of AI capabilities: [🚢Learning Roadmap for intelligent API, ML, and AI 🗿](#LearningRoadmap)

### Course Series Structure
Spanning **two semesters** (12–18 weeks each, depending on institutional scheduling), the course is structured as follows:

* Web Development — 💪
  * 1️⃣ Foundations and CI/CD using Github
  * 2️⃣ Foundations for LLM-Powered Apps

This course emphasizes applied practice, technical fluency, and ethical awareness through the integration of LLMs into accessible, user-centric web platforms.

### ✨ Course Features 

_This course series_ emphasizes the following **action-oriented** learning outcomes, each grounded in Blooms' Taxonomy’s higher-order verbs and mapped to real-world development practices:

- 🏗️ **Construct** a capstone **project** 🎓 — integrating AI capabilities, multilingual interfaces, LLM APIs, and interactive data visualizations.
    
- 🌍 **Design** inclusive, multilingual **experiences** 💱 — incorporating WCAG accessibility, sustainable design principles, and internationalization/localization (i18n/L10n).
    
- 📢 **Communicate** technical **decisions** 🗄 — through structured documentation (MRDs, PRDs), interactive prototypes, deployed apps, and rubric-based peer evaluations.
    
- ⛏ **Clarify** foundational **concepts** 🧠 — including HTTP protocols, web standards, responsive layouts, Hugo modularity, Tailwind workflows, and prompt design for LLMs.
    
- 🧩 **Compose** responsive **user interfaces** 🗗 and interactive **visualizations** 📊 — using Hugo page bundles, TailwindCSS, and Apache ECharts to build tables, network graphs, geographical maps, and more.
    
- 📎 **Manage** multimodal and structured **assets** 🗂️ — such as images (vector vs. raster), video content, structured datasets (.json, .yaml, .csv, .xml), and production-ready HTML/CSS/JS.
    
- ⏿ **Orchestrate** reproducible **deployments** 🛫 — through Git-based version control, automated bundling, CI/CD workflows, and open-source configuration strategies.
    
- 🔌 **Integrate** LLM-powered **APIs** 📲 — to generate adaptive content, support real-time interactions, and implement prompt-to-page web flows.
    
- 🧭 **Evaluate** ethical and human-centered **implications** 🕵 — addressing algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, and Responsible AI principles

Together, these features illustrate how students, through a **project-based learning journey**, can continuously expand, revise, and reflect on, their growth. 

Culminating in a capstone **project** 🎓, each learner’s contributions, peer-review, peer-learning and feedback cycles are tracked and recorded on GitHub to foster transparency and real-world readiness.

##### In short
**Intelligent** Web Development requires continuous learning skillsets that leverage modern platforms such as Github for professional project-based traceable professional practices. 
{{% /callout %}}

Two course syllabus are provided as follows:
* First, learners build a modern responsive website using Github, learning the fundamental components, Web knowledge, design practices, and basic deployment operations.
* Second, learners build several LLM-powered Apps (and other projects) that feature intelligent value-adds to their well-curated portfolio of documents, projects, interactive data dashboards, etc.

After finishing the _this course series_, each learner will align their interests and practices, growing with the world-leading projects and contributors on platforms such as <i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [🤗Hugging Face Hub ](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index), both of which provide extra education resources:
