[Valdecy/pybibx](https://github.com/Valdecy/pybibx) is a bibliometric Python library developed by 
Â [Valdecy Pereira](mailto:valdecy.pereira@gmail.com).  It features with several capabilities such as reading citation data from the Scopus (.bib files or .csv files), WoS (.bib files) and PubMed (.txt files), generating network analysis insights (e.g. identification of the Princes of the Sleeping Beauties), and AI capabilities (e.g. summarization and questions-answering using Gemini and chatGPT APIs).  

[Han-Teng Liao](/experience) seeks the extensions of pybibx for processing Chinese-language citation datasets.
