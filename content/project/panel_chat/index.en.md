[`Panel Chat Examples`](https://holoviz-topics.github.io/panel-chat-examples/) feature [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) and its  _multi modal_ chat components that support [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/), [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), etc.

[Han-Teng Liao](/experience) seeks the useful extensions of `Panel Chat Examples` for doing and learning AI-powered interactive data visualization for insights.

While there are [several Python Frameworks to build UIs for AI Apps](https://getstream.io/blog/ai-chat-ui-tools/#3-chainlit-build-uis-for-conversational-ai), Panel (Holoviz) features a few chatbot UIs within its browser-based data visualization ecosystems.  Thus, although more general tools such as [`Gradio Python Client`](https://www.gradio.app/docs/python-client/introduction) and [`ai-chatbot by Vercel`](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot) exist to build AI Apps with chatbots, it is still useful to learn and do "smart" interactive data-visualization using Panel (Holoviz).
