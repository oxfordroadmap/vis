The ground-breaking project, the [`Blavatnik Index of Public Administration`](https://github.com/blavatnik-index/bipa2024_index) by the University of Oxford, provides data on the performance of civil services around the globe.  In 2024, the Index has integrated 82 data points from 17 different sources that cover 120 countries around the world, released with R source code and a dedicated website:Â [https://index.bsg.ox.ac.uk](https://index.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). 

To advance such comparative benchmarking using the dataset, the extended [Synthetic data and smart applications of Blavatnik Index of Public Administration](https://github.com/hanteng/bipa2024_index) seeks to develop AI-driven insights.
